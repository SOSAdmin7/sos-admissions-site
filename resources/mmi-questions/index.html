        <h2>What Is the MMI Format?</h2>
        <p>The Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) is an interview format used by many medical schools, dental schools, pharmacy programs, and other health profession programs. Unlike a traditional interview with one interviewer and a set of standard questions, the MMI consists of <strong>6 to 10 short stations</strong>, each lasting approximately <strong>8 minutes</strong>.</p>
        <p>At each station, you are presented with a scenario or prompt. You typically have 2 minutes to read the prompt and collect your thoughts, followed by 6 minutes to discuss your response with the evaluator. Each station is assessed independently, which means a poor performance at one station does not necessarily ruin your overall score.</p>
        <p>The MMI is designed to evaluate communication skills, ethical reasoning, critical thinking, and your ability to think on your feet. Because each station has a different evaluator, the format reduces the impact of individual interviewer bias.</p>

        <h2>10 Sample MMI Questions with Answer Tips</h2>

        <h3>1. "A patient refuses a life-saving blood transfusion due to religious beliefs. What do you do?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Acknowledge the patient's autonomy and right to make decisions about their own body. Demonstrate that you understand informed consent. Discuss how you would ensure the patient fully understands the consequences, explore alternative treatments, and respect their decision while documenting everything thoroughly.</p>

        <h3>2. "You witness a classmate cheating on an exam. How do you handle this?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Address the tension between loyalty to a friend and integrity. Consider speaking privately with the classmate first. Discuss the importance of academic honesty in a profession built on trust. Explain why reporting may ultimately be necessary and how you would approach the situation with compassion rather than judgment.</p>

        <h3>3. "A pharmaceutical company offers to fund your research but wants to influence the results."</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Show awareness of conflicts of interest in medicine and research. Explain the importance of research integrity and unbiased results for patient safety. Discuss how you would decline the conditional terms while potentially exploring ethical funding alternatives.</p>

        <h3>4. "An elderly patient wants to stop their medication against medical advice."</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Respect the patient's autonomy while fulfilling your duty to inform. Describe how you would explore the patient's reasoning, address any concerns or side effects, involve family with the patient's consent, and document that you provided thorough information about risks.</p>

        <h3>5. "You discover your supervisor has been falsifying patient records."</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This tests your commitment to patient safety over hierarchy. Discuss the seriousness of falsified records, the duty to report, and the appropriate channels (department head, compliance office). Acknowledge that this is difficult but emphasize that patient safety must come first.</p>

        <h3>6. "A parent refuses to vaccinate their child. How do you approach this?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid being confrontational. Demonstrate empathy by understanding the parent's concerns. Discuss using evidence-based information to educate, addressing specific fears, and considering the broader public health implications. Emphasize building trust over being authoritarian.</p>

        <h3>7. "You have limited resources. How do you decide who receives treatment first?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> This is a triage and resource allocation question. Discuss established ethical frameworks like urgency, likelihood of benefit, and fairness. Avoid making decisions based on social worth. Show that you understand the complexity and that there may not be a single "right" answer.</p>

        <h3>8. "A colleague comes to work appearing impaired. What do you do?"</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Prioritize patient safety. Describe how you would approach the colleague privately and with compassion, ensure they do not provide patient care in that state, and follow institutional reporting procedures. Acknowledge that substance issues are a health concern, not purely a disciplinary one.</p>

        <h3>9. "Tell me about a time you faced a difficult ethical decision."</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose a genuine example from your life. Structure your answer: describe the situation, the competing values at stake, how you weighed your options, what you decided, and what you learned. Interviewers are looking for self-reflection and moral reasoning, not a perfect outcome.</p>

        <h3>10. "You disagree with an attending physician's treatment plan."</h3>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Show respect for hierarchy while demonstrating that patient welfare is paramount. Describe how you would respectfully voice your concerns, present evidence to support your perspective, and seek input from other team members if needed. Emphasize collaboration over confrontation.</p>

        <h2>General Tips for Answering MMI Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consider all perspectives.</strong> Most MMI prompts involve multiple stakeholders. Acknowledge the patient, the family, colleagues, and the broader community.</li>
          <li><strong>Acknowledge complexity.</strong> Avoid jumping to a black-and-white answer. The interviewers want to see that you recognize nuance and can think through competing values.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay structured.</strong> Use a clear framework: identify the core issue, consider stakeholder perspectives, propose a course of action, and explain your reasoning.</li>
          <li><strong>Be genuine.</strong> Interviewers can tell when you are giving a rehearsed answer. Speak honestly and show real reflection.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice under timed conditions.</strong> The 2-minute prep plus 6-minute response format feels rushed at first. Practice with a timer so you get comfortable with the pacing.</li>
          <li><strong>Do not rush to conclude.</strong> It is better to think through a question carefully and leave some time unused than to blurt out a half-formed answer.</li>
        </ul>
