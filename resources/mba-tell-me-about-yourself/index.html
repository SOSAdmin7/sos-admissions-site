        <h2>Why This Question Matters</h2>
        <p>"Tell me about yourself" is almost always the first question in an MBA interview, and it matters more than most candidates realize. Your answer sets the tone for the entire conversation. A strong opening builds momentum and gives the interviewer a framework for the questions that follow. A weak or rambling answer can put you on the back foot for the rest of the interview.</p>
        <p>Admissions committees use this question to evaluate several things at once: your communication skills, your self-awareness, the clarity of your career vision, and how well you can connect your past experiences to your future goals. They are not looking for your life story. They want a concise, compelling narrative that explains who you are, why you are here, and where you are going.</p>

        <h2>The Framework: Present-Past-Future</h2>
        <p>The most effective structure for answering "Tell me about yourself" in an MBA interview is the <strong>Present-Past-Future</strong> framework. This approach keeps your answer focused and forward-looking.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Present:</strong> Start with where you are now. What is your current role? What do you do, and what are you good at? Keep this to 2-3 sentences.</li>
          <li><strong>Past:</strong> Briefly explain how you got here. What key experiences, decisions, or turning points shaped your career path? Choose 1-2 highlights that are relevant to your MBA goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Future:</strong> Explain why you want an MBA now, what you plan to do with it, and why this specific program is the right fit. This is the most important part because it shows intentionality.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your entire answer should take <strong>90 seconds to 2 minutes</strong>. Anything longer and you risk losing the interviewer's attention.</p>

        <h2>Example Answers</h2>

        <h3>Example 1: Career Changer (Engineer to Product Management)</h3>
        <p>"I'm currently a senior software engineer at a mid-size fintech company, where I lead a team of four developers building our mobile payments platform. Over the past three years, I've increasingly found myself drawn to the product side. I've been the one pushing for user research, sitting in on customer calls, and proposing new features based on data I pulled myself. Before this role, I spent two years at a consulting firm where I first developed my interest in how technology solves real business problems. I'm pursuing an MBA because I want to formally transition into product management, ideally at a company working on financial inclusion. [School name]'s focus on technology leadership and its strong fintech alumni network make it the perfect place for me to make that transition."</p>

        <h3>Example 2: Consultant</h3>
        <p>"I'm an engagement manager at a strategy consulting firm, where I currently lead healthcare projects for Fortune 500 clients. Over the past five years, I've worked across industries, but healthcare is where I've found my passion. I saw firsthand how a supply chain redesign we proposed for a hospital network saved them $12 million annually and improved patient outcomes. Before consulting, I studied economics and public health, which gave me the analytical foundation I use every day. I want an MBA to move from advising healthcare companies to leading one. My long-term goal is to run operations at a health-tech company, and [School name]'s healthcare management concentration and its hospital partnerships would give me the hands-on experience I need."</p>

        <h3>Example 3: Entrepreneur</h3>
        <p>"I'm the co-founder of a direct-to-consumer wellness brand that I started three years ago. We've grown from zero to $2 million in annual revenue and we're now in 200 retail locations. I handle everything from supply chain negotiations to digital marketing. Before starting the company, I worked in brand management at a consumer goods company where I learned the fundamentals of product launches and retail strategy. I'm pursuing an MBA because I've taken this business as far as I can with my current skills. I need a deeper understanding of finance, scaling operations, and organizational leadership to take us to $20 million. [School name]'s entrepreneurship program and its venture incubator are exactly what I need to get there."</p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Starting from childhood.</strong> The interviewer does not need to know where you grew up or what you studied in high school. Start with your professional present.</li>
          <li><strong>Reciting your resume.</strong> Your interviewer has already read your application. Add context and narrative instead of listing job titles and dates.</li>
          <li><strong>Being too vague about goals.</strong> "I want an MBA to explore my options" is one of the weakest answers you can give. Be specific about your post-MBA direction even if it might change later.</li>
          <li><strong>Talking too long.</strong> If your answer goes past 2 minutes, it is too long. Practice with a timer until you can deliver it naturally within the window.</li>
          <li><strong>Forgetting the "why this school" component.</strong> Many candidates describe their past well but fail to connect it to the specific program. Always end with why you chose this school.</li>
          <li><strong>Sounding rehearsed.</strong> Know your key points but deliver them conversationally. Memorizing a script word-for-word sounds robotic.</li>
        </ul>
