        <p>Medical school interviews are your chance to demonstrate the personal qualities that admissions committees care about most: empathy, integrity, critical thinking, and a genuine commitment to medicine. Whether you are preparing for a traditional one-on-one interview or an MMI, the question categories below will help you build a strong foundation.</p>

        <h2>Why Medicine</h2>
        <p>These questions get to the core of your motivation. Interviewers want to see that your interest in medicine is rooted in real experiences, not just an abstract desire to help people.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>"Why do you want to be a doctor?"</strong> &mdash; Be specific. Connect your answer to particular experiences that deepened your commitment.</li>
          <li><strong>"When did you first become interested in medicine?"</strong> &mdash; Share the moment or experience that sparked your interest, and explain how it evolved over time.</li>
          <li><strong>"Why medicine and not nursing, PA, or another health profession?"</strong> &mdash; Show that you understand what is unique about the physician's role without disparaging other professions.</li>
          <li><strong>"What would you do if you did not get into medical school?"</strong> &mdash; Demonstrate commitment while showing you have realistic backup plans and resilience.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Clinical Scenarios</h2>
        <p>These questions test your ability to think through real-world medical situations, even though you are not yet a physician. Focus on demonstrating empathy, sound judgment, and awareness of boundaries.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>"A patient is diagnosed with a terminal illness and asks you not to tell their family. What do you do?"</strong> &mdash; Balance patient confidentiality with the family's desire for information.</li>
          <li><strong>"How would you deliver bad news to a patient?"</strong> &mdash; Show empathy, directness, and awareness of the emotional impact.</li>
          <li><strong>"A patient comes in with symptoms they clearly found on the internet and insists on a specific treatment. How do you handle it?"</strong> &mdash; Validate their concern while gently guiding them toward evidence-based care.</li>
          <li><strong>"You notice a fellow medical student showing signs of depression. What do you do?"</strong> &mdash; Demonstrate compassion and knowledge of available resources.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p>Ethical questions are among the most challenging in medical school interviews. There is rarely a single right answer. Interviewers are evaluating your reasoning process more than your conclusion.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>"Should physicians be allowed to assist in ending a terminally ill patient's life?"</strong> &mdash; Present both sides thoughtfully before sharing your perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>"Is it ethical to use placebos in treatment?"</strong> &mdash; Discuss the tension between deception and potential benefit.</li>
          <li><strong>"A patient cannot afford their medication. What are your responsibilities as their physician?"</strong> &mdash; Show awareness of healthcare access issues and the physician's role as an advocate.</li>
          <li><strong>"Should organ donation be opt-out rather than opt-in?"</strong> &mdash; Consider individual autonomy versus public health benefit.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Personal Questions</h2>
        <p>Personal questions help interviewers get to know you as a person beyond your application. Be authentic and reflective.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>"Tell me about yourself."</strong> &mdash; Use a structured approach: present role, key past experiences, and why medicine now.</li>
          <li><strong>"What is your greatest strength?"</strong> &mdash; Choose a strength relevant to medicine and support it with a specific example.</li>
          <li><strong>"What is your biggest weakness?"</strong> &mdash; Be honest about a real area of growth, and explain what you are doing to improve.</li>
          <li><strong>"Describe a time you failed and what you learned from it."</strong> &mdash; Show self-awareness, resilience, and genuine learning.</li>
          <li><strong>"How do you handle stress?"</strong> &mdash; Give concrete strategies and examples from your own experience.</li>
          <li><strong>"What do you do outside of academics?"</strong> &mdash; Show that you are a well-rounded person with interests and commitments beyond medicine.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>School-Specific Questions</h2>
        <p>These questions test whether you have done your research on the program. Generic answers stand out in a bad way.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>"Why do you want to attend this medical school?"</strong> &mdash; Reference specific programs, research opportunities, clinical sites, or community aspects.</li>
          <li><strong>"How will you contribute to our class and community?"</strong> &mdash; Connect your unique background and experiences to the school's values and culture.</li>
          <li><strong>"What questions do you have for us?"</strong> &mdash; Always have 2-3 thoughtful questions prepared. Ask about things you genuinely want to know, not things easily found on the website.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Prepare Effectively</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Practice your answers out loud, not just in your head. Speaking and thinking are different skills.</li>
          <li>Record yourself and review your delivery. Look for filler words, pacing issues, and body language.</li>
          <li>Do at least one full mock interview with someone who can give honest feedback.</li>
          <li>Research current healthcare issues and be prepared to discuss them.</li>
          <li>Review your application thoroughly. Any experience you mentioned could become a question.</li>
        </ul>
